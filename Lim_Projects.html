                <p style="text-align:center">The idea of the project was to create a game within Scratch, utilizing certain block functions in order to produce an interactive story with branching paths. 
                My partner and I brainstormed numerous ideas within documentation, and decided upon creating a Prison Escape, where the player could decide between branching paths that were created using Scratch assets, sequences, and block functions. 
                Through usage of multiple backdrops, sprites, and blocks which can hide, change, and move certain elements under specific conditions, we successfully created a functioning Prison Escape game. My primary role within the entire project was primarily experimenting with the coding and working with my partner to ensure the code functioned properly the way that we wanted it to. 
                The Scratch project helped developed our skills in becoming more familiar with utilizing functions that were within Scratch, as we carefully experimented with our code, and developed our experience with programming further.
                We also utilized <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avDVXJXfhFj4rRs3_oNmEVLKecSyMU4f4a0YOjbHRyw/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a> throughout the development of our project, in a similar fashion to a design notebook that has many topics within the project documentated.

                <p style="text-align:center">The entire concept of the MIT App Inventor project was to utilize the assets of MIT App Inventor in order to create an app that represented a quiz of some sort.
                My partner and I had brainstormed numerous features that we could add to the quiz, and we ultimately decided on creating a multiple choice quiz that contained a Fortnite theme, a popular video game that many people throughout the world know.
                Utilizing certain functions within MIT App Inventor, we were thorough in the features that we added, such as pictures, randomized order of response buttons, a scoring feature, music, a retry button, and a title screen.
                Throughout the entire project, my primary role was working with my partner to properly program the multiple choice quiz in order for it to appear in a functioning fashion.
                While designing the quiz, we kept moderation in mind, trying to make the quiz not too difficult and making sure that the quiz would keep the person who is playing entertained and engaged enough, tying a balance between the two mechanics. 
                For the project, we created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8WZ17yo-U4jIc4ENhtlfNnftL6Fm4bzYrbbpehUfdg/edit?usp=sharing">design notebook</a> in order to track all of our changes and development for the app.
