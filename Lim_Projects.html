                <p style="text-align:center">The idea of the project was to create a game within Scratch, utilizing certain block functions in order to produce an interactive story with branching paths. 
                My partner and I brainstormed numerous ideas within documentation, and decided upon creating a Prison Escape, where the player could decide between branching paths that were created using Scratch assets, sequences, and block functions. 
                Through usage of multiple backdrops, sprites, and blocks which can hide, change, and move certain elements under specific conditions, we successfully created a functioning Prison Escape game. My primary role within the entire project was primarily experimenting with the coding and working with my partner to ensure the code functioned properly the way that we wanted it to. 
                The Scratch project helped developed our skills in becoming more familiar with utilizing functions that were within Scratch, as we carefully experimented with our code, and developed our experience with programming further.
                We also utilized <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avDVXJXfhFj4rRs3_oNmEVLKecSyMU4f4a0YOjbHRyw/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a> throughout the development of our project, in a similar fashion to a design notebook that has many topics within the project documentated.

                <h2 style="text-align:center">February 2019, Computer Science Principles</h2>
                <p style="text-align:center">The entire concept of the Python Image Manipulation project was to demonstrate our comprehension of the programming language through altering various and multiple images within a directory for a specific client.
                The client that my partner and I had chose was Client #2; A family that was requesting a standard frame applied to numerous pictures that feature the family members, along with additional miscellaneous features. 
                My partner and I had devised multiple ideas that we had in mind for certain frames that would properly portray the options and concepts that the family would most likely find ideal for a frame.
                We began our project with the base format given to us of a function that had rounded the corners of a picture, and utilizing the PIL handbook in addition, we were capable of creating various functions of our own that implemented certain aesthetics to the image, such as borders, pasting logos, text, and various other filters that altered the appearance and shape of the image.
                Through trial and error, we were capable of improvising our code by reviewing over it, condensing it, and improving the overall usage and appearance by creating new parameters that would be inserted into the function call at the end of the python document.
                In conclusion, the Python project that my partner and I had worked on assisted in developing our coordination and abstraction skills, as we were capable of following a moderately comprehensive format that we used in developing our image manipulation code, along with researching various elements within the PIL handbook, bolstering our knowledge on the programming language even further.
                
                For the project, we created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CuUAD19rW3LpFeO_mM82d5JXmsJsnbJ4pZOT1FcAkg/edit?usp=sharing">design notebook</a> in order to track all of our changes and development for the project.
