                <p style="text-align:center">The idea of the project was to create a game within Scratch, utilizing certain block functions in order to produce an interactive story with branching paths. 
                My partner and I brainstormed numerous ideas within documentation, and decided upon creating a Prison Escape, where the player could decide between branching paths that were created using Scratch assets, sequences, and block functions. 
                Through usage of multiple backdrops, sprites, and blocks which can hide, change, and move certain elements under specific conditions, we successfully created a functioning Prison Escape game. My primary role within the entire project was primarily experimenting with the coding and working with my partner to ensure the code functioned properly the way that we wanted it to. 
                The Scratch project helped developed our skills in becoming more familiar with utilizing functions that were within Scratch, as we carefully experimented with our code, and developed our experience with programming further.
                We also utilized <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7C43eXTmLrWeGGqHVPvFIURvqfTqmLFBiPWuYZcRYA/edit">documentation</a> throughout the development of our project, in a similar fashion to a design notebook that has many topics within the project documentated.
